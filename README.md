# Workshop: Backend Fundamentals - Pet Finder

## Introduction

In this workshop, you'll be provided this GitHub repo with details for a full operational CRUD API that uses Express.JS, PostgreSQL, and other technologies that you've been trained on.

## Problems to Solve

Begin this Career Simulation by cloning the GitHub repo, pseudocoding prompts, installing dependencies and solving the problems below.

### Problem 1: GET all pets

### STRETCH GOAL: Problem 4: Serve a static index.html file
